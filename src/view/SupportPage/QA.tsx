		question: `My assets are in Terra Station. How can I bridge them to other chains?`,
		answer: `As of now, Keplr is the only wallet supported to move via Satellite. Integration with other wallets is in progress. Until then, you can transfer your assets to a Keplr wallet and use Satellite with them.`

		question: `Can I move non-Axelar Wrapped UST / LUNA via Satellite?`,
		answer: <div><div>No. Satellite supports moving of Axelar Wrapped Assets only. Before you deposit your tokens to the deposit address, please verify that you’re using the correct token contract.
			If you send a non-Axelar wrapped asset to the deposit address, it will be lost.</div><br/>

				onClick={() => window.open(configs.tokenContracts[process.env.REACT_APP_STAGE as string], '_blank')}

		question: `Can I use Ledger with Keplr to send my assets?`,
		answer: `Not at this moment. We’re actively investigating this problem and hope to resolve it as soon as possible.`
	}, {
		question: `How can I ask for help?`,
		answer: <div>
			If your asset doesn’t arrive after sufficient time has passed (15-30 minutes for all chains, except Ethereum, where transactions are triggered at 30m+ intervals), then:
			<ul>
				<li>Confirm that your transaction on the source chain went through via the corresponding explorer.</li>
				<li>Confirm that you sent the assets to the Axelar-generated deposit address.</li>
				<li>Confirm that you’ve sent the tokens to the desired destination chain & added the token contract to your metamask wallet{" "}
					<PopoutLink
						text={configs.tokenContracts[process.env.REACT_APP_STAGE as string]}
						onClick={() => window.open(configs.tokenContracts[process.env.REACT_APP_STAGE as string], '_blank')}
					/>
					. Try searching your transaction in the destination chain’s explorer based on your destination address.</li>
			</ul>
			If you still can’t find it, copy the Trace ID & the destination address & your transaction on the source chain and post in <BoldSpan>#satellite-bridge-support</BoldSpan> channel on Discord.
